:star: Star this on GitHub â€” it helps!

[Search Vehicle](https://search-vehicle.netlify.app/) is a react based web application which helps the user to filter out the data in the search menu using vehicle type, vehicle make, and vehicle year. By using this website the users can search and locate the vehicles that were released between the year of 1995 and 2022. The data is extracted from the API which can be found using this link - https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/

## How to interact?

---

The website provides three options for filtering the results: Manufacturer, Type, and Model year of the vehicle. The users can choose either the name of the manufacturer (upto five) or the vehicle type or both of them simultaneously. The users will also have a provision of selecting a particular year for further refinement in the search engine. The default value of the year is set to be 2021. This website is designed adequately to make it responsive and mobile-friendly. The user can visit the website using [Search Vehicle](https://search-vehicle.netlify.app/).

## Comments

---

Currently in this app, the user can filter the results using only one value for the year. The feature of providing the range of year is not added here because of the API boundation. I tried to validate the endpoint using various ways but there is no effective way to get the results for multiple years. I also tried using loop to get results but it increased the load time of the website.
